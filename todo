Sorcerer = sorcerers repeat their attacks once every 3/2 attacks 
Sorcerer + Conjurer = Illusionist - launches a projectile that deals X damage and creates copies that do the same, Lv.3 effect - doubles the number of copies created and they release additional projectiles on death
Sorcerer + Voider = Witch - creates an area that deals X damage over time and seeks nearby enemies, Lv.3 effect - the area periodically releases homing projectiles that pierce 2 times
Sorcerer + Curser = Linker - links 3 enemies together, they share damage taken, Lv.3 effect - link 6 enemies instead and damage shared is doubled
Sorcerer + Nuker = Vulcanist - creates a volcano that explodes the nearby area 5 times, Lv.3 effect - the volcano spawn also deals damage and doubles the number of explosions
Sorcerer + Forcer = Warden - creates a force field around a random unit that prevents enemies from entering, Lv.3 effect - creates the force field around 2 other random units

Patch Notes:
Decreased projectile speed for the exploder (blue enemy)
Added tooltips for "restart run" and "tutorial" buttons on the shop
Fixed text that was going outside the screen for the Priest and the Assassin
Fixed bug where Divine Punishment would continue triggering after death
Removed cooldown visuals on snake for units that don't have cooldowns (Squire, Chronomancer and Psykeeper)
Slightly decreased base game's difficulty
Fixed NG+ difficulty only being able to be lowered, now you can lower or increase it (up to your maximum acquired value)

Future ideas:
Chaos related class = Invoker - shoots a projectile with random properties, Lv.3 effect - ???
