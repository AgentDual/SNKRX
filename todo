    * Sorcerer = sorcerers repeat their attacks once every 4/3/2 attacks 
    * Arcanist (tier 1 sorcerer) - launches a slow piercing orb that launches other piercing projectiles, Lv.3 effect - 50% increased attack speed for the orb and 2 projectiles are released per cast
    * Sorcerer + Conjurer = Illusionist - launches a projectile that deals X damage and creates copies that do the same, Lv.3 effect - doubles the number of copies created and they release 12 projectiles on death that pierce and ricochet once
    * Sorcerer + Voider = Witch - creates an area that ricochets around the arena and deals X damage over time, Lv.3 effect - the area periodically releases projectiles that chain once
    * Sorcerer + Curser = Silencer - curses 6 nearby enemies for 6 seconds, preventing them from using special attacks, Lv.3 effect - the curse also deals X damage over time
    * Sorcerer + Nuker = Vulcanist - creates a volcano that explodes the nearby area 4 times, Lv.3 effect - the number and speed of explosions is doubled
    * Sorcerer + Forcer = Warden - creates a force field around a random unit that prevents enemies from entering, Lv.3 effect - creates the force field around 2 units instead
    * Sorcerer + Psyker = Psychic - creates a small area that deals X damage, Lv.3 effect - the attack can happen from any distance and repeats twice
    * Magician (tier 1 mage) - creates a small area that deals X damage, Lv.3 effect - the magician becomes invulnerable for 6 seconds

  Fixed bug where Divine Punishment would continue triggering after death
  Removed cooldown visuals on snake for units that don't have cooldowns (Squire, Chronomancer and Psykeeper)
  Slightly decreased base game's difficulty
  Fixed NG+ difficulty only being able to be lowered, now you can lower or increase it (up to your maximum acquired value)
  Buffed swarmer movement speed

Future ideas:
Chaos related classes
  Invoker - shoots a projectile with random properties, Lv.3 effect - ???
Trappers:
  Triangler - drops a trap and the 3rd trap will trigger the area, dealing X AoE damage 2-3 times
Brawlers: units focused on crashing on enemies
  https://i.imgur.com/5YubukS.png - unit idea
Hexblaster? - curser that consumes curses to deal damage
Bench? - https://i.imgur.com/B1gNVKk.png
Balance option for when there are more sets - https://i.imgur.com/JMynwbL.png
Negative effect: colliding with yourself kills one of your units
Go through this later https://i.imgur.com/4t7NA32.png <- lots of good improvements
Remove level 3 units from rotation
Hide cursor during waves
Mouse follow control?
Visuals for divine intervertion, fairy buff

Roguelite update:
Slay the Spire-like node selection map (copy code from SHOOTRX repo as this is already implemented there)
Units die permanently when they die
