Engine improvements for after SNKRX release
  Node refactor: described partly somewhere in the devlog
  Rewrite SNKRX: using this game as a target for the node refactor will yield good results for both the refactor and future SNKRX updates, if any
  on_hit:
    on_collision_enter/exit are automatically called and automatically call on_hit/on_leave for each object
    This enables the definition of on_hit on each object and the question of where the logic should stay is solved/dodged
    Spurred by Wall needing to have its own on_hit function to do something when the player hits it, without having to change player code for all Walls,
    Defining on_hit on the Wall creation call for that specific Wall, and thus that specific Wall will have this behavior while other walls won't

    Not sure if I should go all the way with event systems like this or only have it work for specific cases, need to think about it more
  release tool:
    Build a command line tool that creates projects and builds them up for release automatically on Windows, Web and Steam
    All the steps for this are listed on the readme and everything about it that can be automated should
    Ideally the user should run one command for creating a project and one for building it for each platform
