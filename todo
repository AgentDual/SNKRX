Boss ideas

  Lich [mage, enchanter]: nearby enemies have decreased movement speed

Items

  Sage's pull force doesn't increase with unit level
  Cleric's healing amount doesn't increase with unit level
  Squire and Chronomancer's buffs don't increase with unit level

Engine improvements for after SNKRX release
  on_hit:
    on_collision_enter/exit are automatically called and automatically call on_hit/on_leave for each object
    This enables the definition of on_hit on each object and the question of where the logic should stay is solved/dodged
    Spurred by Wall needing to have its own on_hit function to do something when the player hits it, without having to change player code for all Walls,
    Defining on_hit on the Wall creation call for that specific Wall, and thus that specific Wall will have this behavior while other walls won't
