Sorcerer update patch notes
Summary: This update adds 1 new class with 8 new units, implements more QoL features, further balance changes and lots of bug fixes.
  Added sorcerer class: sorcerers repeat their attacks once every 4/3/2 attacks 
  Added 8 new units:
    Arcanist (tier 1 sorcerer) - launches a slow piercing orb that launches other piercing projectiles, Lv.3 effect - 50% increased attack speed for the orb and 2 projectiles are released per cast
    Illusionist (tier 3 sorcerer, conjurer) - launches a projectile that deals X damage and creates copies that do the same, Lv.3 effect - doubles the number of copies created and they release 12 projectiles on death that pierce and ricochet once
    Witch (tier 2 sorcerer, voider) - creates an area that ricochets around the arena and deals X damage over time, Lv.3 effect - the area periodically releases projectiles that chain once
    Silencer (tier 2 sorcerer, curser) - curses 6 nearby enemies for 6 seconds, preventing them from using special attacks, Lv.3 effect - the curse also deals X damage over time
    Vulcanist (tier 4 sorcerer, nuker) - creates a volcano that explodes the nearby area 4 times, Lv.3 effect - the number and speed of explosions is doubled
    Warden (tier 4 sorcerer, forcer) - creates a force field around a random unit that prevents enemies from entering, Lv.3 effect - creates the force field around 2 units instead
    Psychic (tier 2 sorcerer, psyker) - creates a small area that deals X damage, Lv.3 effect - the attack can happen from any distance and repeats twice
    Magician (tier 1 mage) - creates a small area that deals X damage, Lv.3 effect - the magician becomes invulnerable for 6 seconds
  Changed cursers to trigger only when near enemies
  Decreased projectile speed for the exploder (blue enemy)
  Changed shooters (white enemy) to scale with NG+ difficulty
  Increased damage and movement speed for enemy swarmers (small purple enemies)
  Added tooltips for "restart run" and "guide" buttons on the shop
  Fixed text that was going outside the screen for the Priest and the Assassin
  Fixed bug where Divine Punishment would continue triggering after death
  Removed cooldown visuals on snake for units that don't have cooldowns (Squire, Chronomancer and Psykeeper)
  Slightly decreased base game's difficulty
  Fixed NG+ difficulty only being able to be lowered, now you can lower or increase it (up to your maximum acquired value)
  Buffed swarmer movement speed
  Fixed a visual bug with the cleric, its cooldown was showing as faster than it actually was and thus gave the impression of not healing when it should
  Changed Corruptor to tier 4
  Changed Host to tier 3
  Changed Wizard to tier 2
  Removed Lich (will come back in future update)
  Added Magician (tier 1 mage)
  Change Outlaw to tier 2

  Change Wizard's Lv.3 effect's chain to 2 (from 3)
  Fixed Blade's Lv.3 effect's damage text not being rounded
  Fixed headbutter (orange enemy) damage buff lasting too long after an attack
  Fixed a crash whenever the Fairy would try to select a unit that just died this or last frame
  Fixed a crash that would happen when trying to restart the game through the menu on the passive selection screen
  Fixed a bug where you could die and win at the same time
  Fixed a crash triggered by infested enemies on death rarely
  Fixed a bug where quitting on level 1 would automatically jump to level 2
  Fixed a bug where lock state would carry over after a run death/win/restart
  Fixed a bug where items from a previous restarted run would remain after the 1st round

Future ideas:
Chaos related classes
  Invoker - shoots a projectile with random properties, Lv.3 effect - ???
Trappers:
  Triangler - drops a trap and the 3rd trap will trigger the area, dealing X AoE damage 2-3 times
Brawlers: units focused on crashing on enemies
  https://i.imgur.com/5YubukS.png - unit idea
Conjurer unit that creates an unit that actively protects you from enemy projectiles
Passive that makes critters and summons block enemy projectiles
Hexblaster? - curser that consumes curses to deal damage
Bench? - https://i.imgur.com/B1gNVKk.png
Balance option for when there are more sets - https://i.imgur.com/JMynwbL.png
Negative effect: colliding with yourself kills one of your units
Go through this later https://i.imgur.com/4t7NA32.png <- lots of good improvements
Remove level 3 units from rotation
Hide cursor during waves
Mouse follow control?
Visuals for divine intervertion, fairy buff
Fix enemies still spawning after arena clear (this happens with the extra enemy spawns that were blocked earlier)

Roguelite update:
Slay the Spire-like node selection map (copy code from SHOOTRX repo as this is already implemented there)
Units die permanently when they die
