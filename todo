Engine improvements for after SNKRX release
  on_hit:
    on_collision_enter/exit are automatically called and automatically call on_hit/on_leave for each object
    This enables the definition of on_hit on each object and the question of where the logic should stay is solved/dodged
    Spurred by Wall needing to have its own on_hit function to do something when the player hits it, without having to change player code for all Walls,
    Defining on_hit on the Wall creation call for that specific Wall, and thus that specific Wall will have this behavior while other walls won't

    Not sure if I should go all the way with event systems like this or only have it work for specific cases, need to think about it more
