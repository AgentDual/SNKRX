[SNKRX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/) is an arcade shooter roguelite where you control a snake of heroes that automatically attack nearby enemies.
Combine different heroes to unlock class bonuses and create unique builds, and steer your unstoppable party as they ravage through endless waves of enemies.

### Everything Mod Related

This mod is meant to rebalance the game. Make items and units more viable, nerf the OP stuff and maybe more. 
I'm planning to make this mod combine with Despacit2p0's mod but I'll include that in a different branch as I want to make this mod it's own standalone

If you're having difficulties opening the mod, just ask in the modding section or @ me in the discord server :)

Remember, this is an early version so changes may not be working properly. I also still have more changes to add and more testing to do.

Last but not least, don't savescum. It really does ruin the game to a certain extent. I hope that you'll live up to my expectations! (Yes, this is emotional blackmail)

There are many changes (Note that I may miss some important ones) in this mod but IMO, the most important changes are:
- New item and unit descriptions
- Ceremonial/Flying dagger nerf
- Dividends should have a cap of 1000%
- Other builds such as DoT, Knockback, Cursers, Builders and Rangers are more viable through better items and units
- New tier 1's are: Sentry
- New tier 2's are: Host
- New tier 3's are: Plague Doctor, Psykino, Cannoneer
- New tier 4's are: Gambler, Dual Gunners 
- Big item changes: Burning Strike, Noxious Strike, Baneling Burst, Whispers of Doom, Hextouch, Divine Punishment, Gravity Field, Oroboros Right, Porcupine Technique and more
- Big unit changes: Silencer, Vulcanist, Carver, Squire, Merchant, Bomber and more
- Class bonuses/class modifiers were slightly affected (Healer set and mage set bonus were buffed to 20/40 but isn't included in the description)
