### Everything Mod Related

This modpack is literally 2 mods! Not much else to it, really. But I really want to add more mods and make this as good as possible before the rewrite goes live.
If you have a mod you want included, let me know and I'll look into it

In addition to compiling the mods, I will balance them if I find certain things are too weak or too powerful. 
This means I may change whatever mod is included and that may not sit right with some people. That's perfectly fine.
I will include the changes I personally made to the mods included in addition to what should be a good synopsis of each mod.

If you're having difficulties opening the mod, just ask in the modding section or @ me in the discord server :)

Remember, this is an early version so changes may not be working properly. I also still have more changes to add and more testing to do.

Last but not least, don't savescum. It really does ruin the game to a certain extent. I hope that you'll live up to my expectations! (Yes, this is emotional blackmail)

Necromancer- She turns pain and misery into critters as a cultist and swarmer
